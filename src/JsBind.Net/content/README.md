# JavaScript content files

All the JavaScript content source files are in the `src` directory.
The bundled file which will be packaged is in the `dist` directory.

If there are any changes to the source files, the source files must be bundled again.
1. Open cmd/PowerShell window with this directory as the working directory
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run bundle`
